When an object's reference count drops to zero, it is eligible for garbage collection, and its memory is deallocated. Reference counting is a simple and efficient way to manage memory for short-lived objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage Collection: While reference counting is effective for many cases, it doesn't handle cyclic references (objects referencing each other in a loop), which would result in memory leaks. Python employs a cyclic garbage collector to detect and collect such cyclically referenced objects.\n",

    "Memory Allocation: Python's memory manager allocates and manages memory in small blocks, known as \"pools.\" Objects are created from these pools, which helps in reducing memory fragmentation and managing memory efficiently.\n",
